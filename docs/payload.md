When submitting a task graph to the Task Cluster Queue (see
[createTask](/docs/reference/platform/queue/reference/api-docs#createTask)) you must provide a
payload for defining the tasks to be executed by the worker. In the case of the
generic worker, the payload must conform to the following schema.

<div data-render-schema="https://schemas.taskcluster.net/generic-worker/v1/payload.json"></div>

The payload comprises of a command to run, environment variables to be set
(optionally encrypted) and a timeout for the task (`maxRunTime`).

The worker will run the task, upload log files, and report back status to the
Queue.
