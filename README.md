# Engines

## Simple engine

This was the first engine to be written, and is, pretty simple. It executes
processes as child processes of the generic-worker process, under the same user
account that the generic-worker process runs as. Note, this means that anything
that the worker has access to, the tasks will also have access to.

This is therefore a pretty insecure engine (tasks can read generic-worker
config file and thus access taskcluster credentials for claiming work from the
Queue).

Also it is impossible for the worker to guarantee a clean task environment
between task runs, since any task can potentially soil the environment by
changing user settings or for example, leaving files around.

## Multiuser engine

This was the next engine to be written, and solves the problem of task
isolation by creating unique OS user accounts for each task that is to be run.
Each task user account (by default) is unprivileged, much like a guest user
account. Once the task has completed, the task user account is purged, and
there should be no further trace of the task on the system. The task user does
not have permission to alter system-wide settings, so after the user account is
purged, the host environment should be restored to a pristine state.

Since the generic-worker process runs under a different user account to the
task processes, taskcluster credentials, signing keys, and other private matter
can be protected from task access. Note, it is the responsibility of the host
owner to lock down resources as necessary, to ensure that an unprivleged
account does not have access to anything private on the machine.

Since tasks run on the host of the worker (without any container technology or
virtualisation technology), toolchains that need to be installed as an
Administrator typically need to be installed on the host environment.
Toolchains that do not require Administrator privileges to be installed can be
installed as task steps.

## Docker engine

Work has started to provide a docker engine, that allows tasks to be executed
in the context of a docker container running on the host system. This has
similar benefits as the multiuser engine (task isolation, protection of host
secrets) but additionally has the advantage that the target execution
environment can be defined in a docker image, varying significantly from the
host environment. This makes it possible to have arbitrary toolchains available
to a task, without needing to roll new host environments, and also allows tasks
to run task steps as the root user, without impacting the security of the host
environment.

At the moment there is only elementary support for running tasks inside a
docker container, and this should not be used in production. The features are
being implemented in [bug 1499055](https://bugzil.la/1499055).

# Obtain prebuilt release

* Download the latest release for your platform from https://github.com/taskcluster/generic-worker/releases
* Download the latest release of taskcluster-proxy for your platform from https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-proxy/releases
* Download the latest release of livelog for your platform from https://github.com/taskcluster/livelog/releases
* For darwin/linux, make the binaries executable: `chmod a+x {generic-worker,livelog,taskcluster-proxy}*`

# Build from source

If you prefer not to use a prepackaged binary, or want to have the latest unreleased version from the development head:

* Head over to https://golang.org/dl/ and follow the instructions for your platform. __NOTE: go 1.8 or higher is required__. Be sure to set your GOPATH to something appropriate.
* Run `go get github.com/taskcluster/livelog`
* Run `go get github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-proxy`

Run `go get -tags multiuser github.com/taskcluster/generic-worker` (windows/darwin) and/or `go get -tags simple github.com/taskcluster/generic-worker` (linux/darwin) and/or `go get -tags docker github.com/taskcluster/generic-worker` (linux). This should also build binaries for your platform.

Run `./build.sh` to check go version, generate code, build binaries, compile (but not run) tests, perform linting, and ensure there are no ineffective assignments in go code.

`./build.sh` takes optional arguments, `-a` to build all platforms, and `-t` to run tests. By default tests are not run and only the current platform is built.

All being well, the binaries will be built in the directory you executed the `build.sh` script from.

# Guide to installation on worker machines

The following instructions should be considered more as a guide rather than
concrete requirements.

They document _possible_ (and simple) ways to install and run generic-worker on
various platforms. Real life production deployments may be integrated quite
differently.

Each installation guide provides a bootstrap script to runs the generic-worker
binary. The bootstrapping script can be easily customised (for example, to deal
with automatic quarantining of workers, waiting for custom events, etc).

## Windows - multiuser build

1. Build or download a `generic-worker.exe` windows multiuser binary.

2. Run the following command to generate an ed25519 private key for signing
   artifacts:

   * `generic-worker.exe new-ed25519-keypair --file C:\generic-worker\ed25519_key`

   The private key will be written to the file `C:\generic-worker\ed25519_key`,
   and the public key will be written to standard out. Keep a copy of the
   public key if you wish to validate artifact signatures.

3. Download NSSM 2.24 from https://nssm.cc/release/nssm-2.24.zip and extract it
   under `C:\`.

4. Install generic-worker as a Windows service running under the `LocalSystem`
   account, by running the following command as an `Administrator`:

   * `generic-worker.exe install service` (see `generic-worker.exe --help` to
     apply non-default configuration settings)

5. Download livelog from https://github.com/taskcluster/livelog/releases and
   place it in `C:\generic-worker\livelog.exe`.

6. Download taskcluster proxy from
   https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-proxy/releases and place it in
   `C:\generic-worker\taskcluster-proxy.exe`.

7. Create `C:\generic-worker\generic-worker.config` with appopriate values.

8. Edit file `C:\generic-worker\generic-worker.config` with appropriate
   settings (see `generic-worker.exe --help` for information).

9. Reboot the machine, and the worker should be running. Check logs under
   `C:\generic-worker\generic-worker.log`.


## macOS - multiuser/simple build

__These instructions require macOS Mojave version 10.14.x__

 1. Log into target user account:

    __Simple build__: Create user account `genericworker` to run the worker
	under, and log in as `genericworker` in a shell.

    __Multiuser build__: Log in as _root_ (`sudo su -`) in a shell.

 2. __Multiuser build only__

    Disable wizards/warning pop ups on first-login to user accounts:

    * `git clone git@github.com:rtrouton/profiles.git`
    * `git -C profiles checkout f23bc6146ca570108dbaa9e3cb8da954ce325002` (just because this is the version I tested, later versions may also be fine)
    * `profiles install -path=profiles/SkipSiriSetup/SkipSiriSetup.mobileconfig`
    * `profiles install -path=profiles/SkipDarkorLightAppearance/SkipDarkorLightAppearance.mobileconfig`
    * `profiles install -path=profiles/Disable32BitApplicationWarning/10.14/Disable32BitApplicationWarning.mobileconfig`
    * `profiles install -path=profiles/SkipDataAndPrivacy/SkipDataAndPrivacy.mobileconfig`
    * `profiles install -path=profiles/SkipiCloudSetup/SkipiCloudSetup.mobileconfig`

 3. Download `generic-worker` from
    https://github.com/taskcluster/generic-worker/releases and place it in
    `/usr/local/bin/generic-worker`.

 4. Download livelog from https://github.com/taskcluster/livelog/releases and
    place it in `/usr/local/bin/livelog`.

 5. Download taskcluster proxy from
    https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-proxy/releases and place it in
    `/usr/local/bin/taskcluster-proxy`.

 6. Make `generic-worker`, `taskcluster-proxy`, `livelog` binaries executable:

    * `chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/{generic-worker,taskcluster-proxy,livelog}`

 7. Generate a key for signing artifacts:

    * `sudo mkdir /etc/generic-worker`

    * __Simple build only__: `sudo chown genericworker:staff /etc/generic-worker`

    * `/usr/local/bin/generic-worker new-ed25519-keypair --file /etc/generic-worker/ed25519_key`

    The private key will be written to the file
    `/etc/generic-worker/ed25519_key`, and the public key will be written to
    standard out. Keep a copy of the public key if you wish to validate artifact
    signatures.

 8. Create the file `/usr/local/bin/run-generic-worker.sh` with the following content:

    ```
    #!/bin/bash

    . /etc/rc.common

    CheckForNetwork

    while [ "${NETWORKUP}" != "-YES-" ]
    do
      sleep 5
      NETWORKUP=
      CheckForNetwork
    done

    /usr/local/bin/generic-worker run --config /etc/generic-worker/config
    ```

 9. Run the following to make the `run-generic-worker.sh` script executable:

    * `chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/run-generic-worker.sh`

10. Create `/etc/generic-worker/config` with appropriate configuration settings
    (see `generic-worker --help` for details). Something like this:

    ```
    {
      "accessToken": "********************************************",
      "cachesDir": "/Library/Caches/generic-worker/caches",
      "cleanUpTaskDirs": true,
      "clientId": "project/foo/bar/my/client",
      "disableReboots": false,
      "downloadsDir": "/Library/Caches/generic-worker/downloads",
      "ed25519SigningKeyLocation": "/etc/generic-worker/ed25519_key",
      "provisionerId": "my-dear-provisioner",
      "publicIP": "1.2.3.4",
      "requiredDiskSpaceMegabytes": 2048,
      "rootURL": "https://my-root-url.com",
      "sentryProject": "generic-worker",
      "shutdownMachineOnIdle": false,
      "shutdownMachineOnInternalError": false,
      "subdomain": "taskcluster-worker.net",
      "taskclusterProxyPort": 8080,
      "tasksDir": "/Users",
      "workerGroup": "my-worker-group",
      "workerId": "my-lovely-computer",
      "workerType": "my-special-worker-type",
      "wstAudience": "taskcluster-net",
      "wstServerURL": "https://websocktunnel.tasks.build"
    }
    ```

11. Create launch daemon:

    Create the file `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mozilla.genericworker.plist`
    with the following content:

    ```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
        <dict>
            <key>Label</key>
            <string>com.mozilla.genericworker</string>
            <key>Program</key>
            <string>/usr/local/bin/run-generic-worker.sh</string>
            <key>StandardOutPath</key>
            <string>/var/log/genericworker/stdout.log</string>
            <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
            <string>/var/log/genericworker/stderr.log</string>
            <key>RunAtLoad</key>
            <true/>
            <key>UserName</key>
            <string>root</string> <----------- (for multiuser build)
            <string>genericworker</string> <----------- (for simple build)
        </dict>
    </plist>
    ```

12. Install launch daemon:

    * `sudo launchctl load -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.mozilla.genericworker.plist`

13. Watch for logs in `/var/log/generic-worker/`.


## Linux simple/multiuser/docker build

 1. Make sure your system is up-to-date. For example, on ubuntu:

    ```
    apt update
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt upgrade -yq
    ```

 2. Install curl (needed for later). For example, on ubuntu:

    ```
    apt install -y curl
    ```

 3. For _multiuser_ ensure Gnome Desktop 3 is installed:

    ```
    apt install -y ubuntu-desktop ubuntu-gnome-desktop
    ```

 4. For _docker_ engine, _or_ if tasks require Docker, install it. For example,
	on ubuntu bionic:

    ```
    apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -
    add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"
    apt update
    apt-cache policy docker-ce | grep -qF download.docker.com
    apt install -y docker-ce
    sleep 5
    systemctl status docker | grep "Started Docker Application Container Engine"
    usermod -aG docker ubuntu
    ```

 5. Download `generic-worker`, `taskcluster-proxy` and `livelog` to `/usr/local/bin`:

    ```
    cd /usr/local/bin
    curl -L "https://github.com/taskcluster/generic-worker/releases/download/<GENERIC_WORKER_VERSION>/generic-worker-multiuser-linux-amd64" > generic-worker
    curl -L "https://github.com/taskcluster/livelog/releases/download/<LIVELOG_VERSION>/livelog-linux-amd64" > livelog
    curl -L "https://github.com/taskcluster/taskcluster-proxy/releases/download/<TASKCLUSTER_PROXY_VERSION>/taskcluster-proxy-linux-amd64" > taskcluster-proxy
    ```

 6. Make binaries executable:

    ```
    chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/{generic-worker,taskcluster-proxy,livelog}
    ```

 7. Create directories required by generic-worker:

    ```
    mkdir -p /etc/generic-worker /var/local/generic-worker
    ```

 8. Check generic-worker works and has correct version:

    ```
    /usr/local/bin/generic-worker --version
    ```

 9. Generate a key for signing artifacts:

    ```
    /usr/local/bin/generic-worker new-ed25519-keypair --file /etc/generic-worker/ed25519_key
    ```

    The private key will be written to the file
    `/etc/generic-worker/ed25519_key`, and the public key will be written to
    standard out. Keep a copy of the public key if you wish to validate artifact
    signatures.

10. Ensure host 'taskcluster' resolves to localhost:

    ```
    echo 127.0.1.1 taskcluster >> /etc/hosts
    ```

11. __AWS workers only__: configure generic-worker to run on boot with
	dynamically provided config from AWS Provisioner:

    ```
    echo '@reboot cd /var/local/generic-worker && PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin /usr/local/bin/generic-worker run --configure-for-aws --config /etc/generic-worker/config >> /var/log/generic-worker.log 2>&1' | crontab -
    ```

	Make sure netplan network renderer takes precendence over eni network
	renderer. See [bug 1499054 comment
    12](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1499054#c12) for an
    explanation.

    ```
    cat > /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/01_network_renderer_policy.cfg << EOF
    system_info:
        network:
          renderers: [ 'netplan', 'eni', 'sysconfig' ]
    EOF
    ```

12. __Non-AWS workers only__: configure generic-worker to run on boot with
	a static local config file:

    ```
    echo '@reboot cd /var/local/generic-worker && PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin /usr/local/bin/generic-worker run --config /etc/generic-worker/config >> /var/log/generic-worker.log 2>&1' | crontab -
    ```

    Create `/etc/generic-worker/config` with appropriate configuration settings
    (see `generic-worker --help` for details).


# Acquire taskcluster credentials for running tests

There are two alternative mechanisms to acquire the scopes you need.

## Option 1

This method works if you log into Taskcluster via mozillians, *or* you log into
taskcluster via LDAP *using the same email address as your mozillians account*,
*or* if you do not currently have a mozillians account but would like to create
one.

* Sign up for a [Mozillians account](https://mozillians.org/en-US/) (if you do not already have one)
* Request membership of the [taskcluster-contributors](https://mozillians.org/en-US/group/taskcluster-contributors/) mozillians group

## Option 2

This method is for those who wish not to create a mozillians account, but
already authenticate into taskcluster via some other means, or have a
mozillians account but it is registered to a different email address than the
one they use to log into Taskcluster with (e.g. via LDAP integration).

* Request the scope `assume:project:taskcluster:generic-worker-tester` to be
  granted to you via a [bugzilla
  request](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Taskcluster&component=Service%20Request),
  including your [currently active `ClientId`](https://tools.taskcluster.net/credentials/)
  in the bug description. From the ClientId, we will be able to work out which role to assign the scope
  to, in order that you acquire the scope with the client you log into Taskcluster tools site with.

Once you have been granted the above scope:

* If you are signed into tools.taskcluster.net already, **sign out**
* Sign into [tools.taskcluster.net](https://tools.taskcluster.net/) using either your new Mozillians account, _or_ your LDAP account **if it uses the same email address as your Mozillians account**
* Check that a role or client of yours appears in [this list](https://tools.taskcluster.net/auth/scopes/assume%3Aproject%3Ataskcluster%3Ageneric-worker-tester)
* Create a permanent client (taskcluster credentials) for yourself in the [Client Manager](https://tools.taskcluster.net/auth/clients/) granting it the single scope `assume:project:taskcluster:generic-worker-tester`

# Set up your env

* Generate an ed25519 key pair with `generic-worker new-ed25519-keypair --file <file>` where `file` is where you want the generated ed25519 private key to be written to
* Create a generic worker configuration file somewhere, with the following content:

```
{
    "accessToken":                "<access token of your permanent credentials>",
    "certificate":                "",
    "clientId":                   "<client ID of your permanent credentials>",
    "ed25519SigningKeyLocation":  "<file location you wrote ed25519 private key to>",
    "livelogSecret":              "<anything you like>",
    "provisionerId":              "test-provisioner",
    "publicIP":                   "<ideally an IP address of one of your network interfaces>",
    "workerGroup":                "test-worker-group",
    "workerId":                   "test-worker-id",
    "workerType":                 "<a unique name that only you will use for your test worker(s)>"
}
```

To see a full description of all the config options available to you, run `generic-worker --help`:

```
generic-worker (multiuser engine) 16.1.0

generic-worker is a taskcluster worker that can run on any platform that supports go (golang).
See http://taskcluster.github.io/generic-worker/ for more details. Essentially, the worker is
the taskcluster component that executes tasks. It requests tasks from the taskcluster queue,
and reports back results to the queue.

  Usage:
    generic-worker run                      [--config         CONFIG-FILE]
                                            [--configure-for-aws | --configure-for-gcp]
    generic-worker show-payload-schema
    generic-worker new-ed25519-keypair      --file ED25519-PRIVATE-KEY-FILE
    generic-worker --help
    generic-worker --version

  Targets:
    run                                     Runs the generic-worker.
    show-payload-schema                     Each taskcluster task defines a payload to be
                                            interpreted by the worker that executes it. This
                                            payload is validated against a json schema baked
                                            into the release. This option outputs the json
                                            schema used in this version of the generic
                                            worker.
    new-ed25519-keypair                     This will generate a fresh, new ed25519
                                            compliant private/public key pair. The public
                                            key will be written to stdout and the private
                                            key will be written to the specified file.

  Options:
    --config CONFIG-FILE                    Json configuration file to use. See
                                            configuration section below to see what this
                                            file should contain. When calling the install
                                            target, this is the config file that the
                                            installation should use, rather than the config
                                            to use during install.
                                            [default: generic-worker.config]
    --configure-for-aws                     Use this option when installing or running a worker
                                            that is spawned by the AWS provisioner. It will cause
                                            the worker to query the EC2 metadata service when it
                                            is run, in order to retrieve data that will allow it
                                            to self-configure, based on AWS metadata, information
                                            from the provisioner, and the worker type definition
                                            that the provisioner holds for the worker type.
    --configure-for-gcp                     This will create the CONFIG-FILE for a GCP
                                            installation by querying the GCP environment
                                            and setting appropriate values.
    --file PRIVATE-KEY-FILE                 The path to the file to write the private key

        ** OPTIONAL ** properties
        =========================

          authBaseURL                       The base URL for taskcluster auth API calls.
                                            If not provided, the base URL for API calls is
                                            instead derived from rootURL setting as follows:
                                              * https://auth.taskcluster.net/v1 for rootURL https://taskcluster.net
                                              * <rootURL>/api/auth/v1 for all other rootURLs
          availabilityZone                  The EC2 availability zone of the worker.
          cachesDir                         The directory where task caches should be stored on
                                            the worker. The directory will be created if it does
                                            not exist. This may be a relative path to the
                                            current directory, or an absolute path.
                                            [default: caches]
          certificate                       Taskcluster certificate, when using temporary
                                            credentials only.
          checkForNewDeploymentEverySecs    The number of seconds between consecutive calls
                                            to the provisioner, to check if there has been a
                                            new deployment of the current worker type. If a
                                            new deployment is discovered, worker will shut
                                            down. See deploymentId property. [default: 1800]
          cleanUpTaskDirs                   Whether to delete the home directories of the task
                                            users after the task completes. Normally you would
                                            want to do this to avoid filling up disk space,
                                            but for one-off troubleshooting, it can be useful
                                            to (temporarily) leave home directories in place.
                                            Accepted values: true or false. [default: true]
          deploymentId                      If running with --configure-for-aws, then between
                                            tasks, at a chosen maximum frequency (see
                                            checkForNewDeploymentEverySecs property), the
                                            worker will query the provisioner to get the
                                            updated worker type definition. If the deploymentId
                                            in the config of the worker type definition is
                                            different to the worker's current deploymentId, the
                                            worker will shut itself down. See
                                            https://bugzil.la/1298010
          disableReboots                    If true, no system reboot will be initiated by
                                            generic-worker program, but it will still return
                                            with exit code 67 if the system needs rebooting.
                                            This allows custom logic to be executed before
                                            rebooting, by patching run-generic-worker.bat
                                            script to check for exit code 67, perform steps
                                            (such as formatting a hard drive) and then
                                            rebooting in the run-generic-worker.bat script.

          downloadsDir                      The directory to cache downloaded files for
                                            populating preloaded caches and readonly mounts. The
                                            directory will be created if it does not exist. This
                                            may be a relative path to the current directory, or
                                            an absolute path. [default: downloads]
          idleTimeoutSecs                   How many seconds to wait without getting a new
                                            task to perform, before the worker process exits.
                                            An integer, >= 0. A value of 0 means "never reach
                                            the idle state" - i.e. continue running
                                            indefinitely. See also shutdownMachineOnIdle.

          runAfterUserCreation              A string, that if non-empty, will be treated as a

                                            has rebooted and the user has logged in, but before
                                            a task is run as that user. This is a way to
                                            provide generic user initialisation logic that
                                            should apply to all generated users (and thus all
                                            tasks) and be run as the task user itself. This

                                            error (such as not being able to write to a
                                            required file) it will shutdown the host
                                            computer. Note this is generally only desired
                                            for machines running in production, such as on AWS
                                            EC2 spot instances. Use with caution!

          workerGroup                       Typically this would be an aws region - an
                                            identifier to uniquely identify which pool of
                                            workers this worker logically belongs to.

          workerManagerBaseURL              The base URL for taskcluster worker-manager API calls.
                                            If not provided, the base URL for API calls is
                                            instead derived from rootURL setting as follows:
                                              * https://worker-manager.taskcluster.net/v1 for rootURL https://taskcluster.net

          workerTypeMetaData                This arbitrary json blob will be included at the
                                            top of each task log. Providing information here,
                                            such as a URL to the code/config used to set up the
                                            worker type will mean that people running tasks on
                                            the worker type will have more information about how
                                            it was set up (for example what has been installed on
                                            the machine).
          wstAudience                       The audience value for which to request websocktunnel
                                            credentials, identifying a set of WST servers this
                                            worker could connect to.  Optional if not using websocktunnel
                                            to expose live logs.
          wstServerURL                      The URL of the websocktunnel server with which to expose
                                            live logs.  Optional if not using websocktunnel to expose
                                            live logs.

    If an optional config setting is not provided in the json configuration file, the
    default will be taken (defaults documented above).

    If no value can be determined for a required config setting, the generic-worker will
    exit with a failure message.

  Exit Codes:

    0      Tasks completed successfully; no more tasks to run (see config setting
           numberOfTasksToRun).
    64     Not able to load generic-worker config. This could be a problem reading the
           generic-worker config file on the filesystem, a problem talking to AWS/GCP
           metadata service, or a problem retrieving config/files from the taskcluster
           secrets service.
    65     Not able to install generic-worker on the system.
    67     A task user has been created, and the generic-worker needs to reboot in order
           to log on as the new task user. Note, the reboot happens automatically unless
           config setting disableReboots is set to true - in either code this exit code will
           be issued.
    68     The generic-worker hit its idle timeout limit (see config settings idleTimeoutSecs
           and shutdownMachineOnIdle).
    69     Worker panic - either a worker bug, or the environment is not suitable for running
           a task, e.g. a file cannot be written to the file system, or something else did
           not work that was required in order to execute a task. See config setting
           shutdownMachineOnInternalError.
    70     A new deploymentId has been issued in the AWS worker type configuration, meaning
           this worker environment is no longer up-to-date. Typcially workers should
           terminate.
    71     The worker was terminated via an interrupt signal (e.g. Ctrl-C pressed).
    72     The worker is running on spot infrastructure in AWS EC2 and has been served a
           spot termination notice, and therefore has shut down.
    73     The config provided to the worker is invalid.
    75     Not able to create an ed25519 key pair.
    76     Not able to save generic-worker config file after fetching it from AWS provisioner
           or Google Cloud metadata.
    77     Not able to apply required file access permissions to the generic-worker config
           file so that task users can't read from or write to it.
```

# Start the generic worker

Simply run:

```
generic-worker run --config <config file>
```

where `<config file>` is the generic worker config file you created above.

# Create a test job

Go to https://tools.taskcluster.net/task-creator/ and create a task to run on your generic worker.

Use [this example](worker_types/win2012r2/task-definition.json) as a template, but make sure to edit `provisionerId` and `workerType` values so that they match what you set in your config file.

Don't forget to submit the task by clicking the *Create Task* icon.

If all is well, your local generic worker should pick up the job you submit, run it, and report back status.

# Modify dependencies

To add, remove, or update dependencies, use [dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/installation.html).
Do not manually edit anything under the `vendor/` directory!

# Run the generic worker test suite

For this you need to have the source files (you cannot run the tests from the binary package).

Then cd into the source directory, and run:

```
go test -v ./...
```

There are a few environment variables that you can set to influence the tests:

### `GW_SKIP_INTEGRATION_TESTS`

Set to a non-empty string if you wish to skip all tests that submit tasks to a
real taskcluster Queue service.

Otherwise you'll need to configure the taskcluster credentials for talking to
the taskcluster Queue service:

* `TASKCLUSTER_CLIENT_ID`
* `TASKCLUSTER_ACCESS_TOKEN`
* `TASKCLUSTER_ROOT_URL`
* `TASKCLUSTER_CERTIFICATE` (only if using temp credentials)

### `GW_SKIP_PERMA_CREDS_TESTS`

Set to a non-empty string if you wish to skip tests that require permanent
taskcluster credentials (e.g. if you only have temp credentials, and don't feel
like creating a permanent client, or don't have the scopes to do so).

### `GW_SKIP_Z_DRIVE_TESTS`

Only used in a single __Windows-specific__ test - if you don't have a Z: drive
setup on your computer, or you do but you also run tests from the Z: drive, you
can set this env var to a non-empty string to skip this test.

### `GW_TESTS_RUN_AS_CURRENT_USER`

This environment variable applies only to the __multiuser__ engine.

If `GW_TESTS_RUN_AS_CURRENT_USER` is not set, generic-worker will be tested
running in its normal operational mode, i.e. running tasks as task users
(config setting `runTasksAsCurrentUser` will be `false`).

If `GW_TESTS_RUN_AS_CURRENT_USER` is a non-empty string, generic-worker will be
tested running tasks as the same user that runs `go test` (config setting
`runTasksAsCurrentUser` will be `true`). This is how the CI multiuser workers
are configured, in order that the generic-worker under test has the required
privileges to function correctly. Set this environment variable to ensure that
the generic-worker under test will function correctly as a generic-worker CI
worker.

# Making a new generic worker release

Run the `release.sh` script like so:

```
$ ./release.sh 16.1.0
```

This will perform some checks, tag the repo, push the tag to github, which will then trigger travis-ci to run tests, and publish the new release.

# Creating and updating worker types

========================

With this release of generic-worker, we now have three unique engines:

* simple
* multiuser
* docker

The generic-worker source code `README.md` provides information about these
different engines, together with updated installation instructions.

This should mostly be a no-op change for Windows/Linux, but due to the large
codebase refactoring and internal reorganisation of code, the major version
number has been bumped to 15.

### Changes

* [Bug 1499051 - Run tasks under unique OS user accounts on darwin (macOS)](https://bugzil.la/1499051)

In v14.1.2 since v14.1.1
========================

* [Bug 1436195 - Add support for live-logs via websocktunnel](https://bugzil.la/1436195) (note that existing livelog support via stateless DNS still works)

  To enable websocktunnel, include configuration options `wstAudience` and `wstServerURL` to correspond to the websocktunnel server the worker should use.
  For the current production environment that would be:

  ```json
  {
    "wstAudience": "taskcluster-net",
    "wstServerURL": "https://websocktunnel.tasks.build"
  }
  ```

  Omit the configuration items `subdomain`, `livelogGETPort`, `livelogCertificate`, `livelogKey`, and `livelogSecret`.
  These options will be removed in a future release.

  Ensure that the worker's credentials have scope `auth:websocktunnel-token:<wstAudience>/<workerGroup>.<workerId>.*`.

In v14.0.2 since v14.0.1
========================

* [Bug 1533694 - generic-worker: create new task user *before* using current task user](https://bugzil.la/1533694)
* [Bug 1543082 - generic-worker: sentry issue GENERIC-WORKER-1J - runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference](https://bugzil.la/1543082)

In v14.0.1 since v14.0.0
========================

Please do not use this release! It has a buggy implementation of bug 1533694 which was fixed in v14.0.2.
* [Bug 1533694 - generic-worker: create new task user *before* using current task user](https://bugzil.la/1533694)

The following bug was backed out:
* [Bug 1436195 - Deploy websocktunnel on generic-worker](https://bugzil.la/1436195)

Support for websocktunnel will be added back in, in generic-worker release 14.1.0.

In v14.0.0 since v13.0.4
========================

The backwardly-incompatible change in release 14.0.0 is that open pgp support has been removed from
Chain Of Trust feature. The following configuration property is no longer supported, and is not
allowed in the generic-worker config file:

```
openpgpSigningKeyLocation
```

**Please note, you need to remove this config property from your config file, if it exists, in order to
work with generic-worker 14 onwards.**

* [Bug 1436195 - Deploy websocktunnel on generic-worker](https://bugzil.la/1436195)
* [Bug 1502335 - Support running a task inside a fixed docker image](https://bugzil.la/1502335)
* [Bug 1534506 - remove cot gpg support](https://bugzil.la/1534506)

In v13.0.4 since v13.0.3
========================

* [Bug 1533402 - Fix for mounting archives in tasks which contain hard links](https://bugzil.la/1533402)

In v13.0.3 since v13.0.2
========================

* [Bug 1531457 - Don't replace existing generic-worker.config file on startup](https://bugzil.la/1531457)

In v13.0.2 since v12.0.0
========================

The backwardly incompatible change for version 13 is that AWS provisioner worker type definitions no longer
store generic-worker secrets. Instead, the secrets should be placed in a taskcluster secrets secret called
`worker-type:aws-provisioner-v1/<workerType>`. The secret could look _something like this_:

```
config:
  livelogSecret: <secret key>
files:
  - content: >-
      <base64>
    description: SSL certificate for livelog
    encoding: base64
    format: file
    path: 'C:\generic-worker\livelog.crt'
  - content: >-
      <base64>
    description: SSL key for livelog
    encoding: base64
    format: file
    path: 'C:\generic-worker\livelog.key'
```

The `secrets` section of the AWS provisioner worker type definition should be an empty json object:

```json
  "secrets": {}
```

Now the `userdata` section of the worker type definition should contain the remaining (non-secret) configuration, e.g.

```json
  "userData": {
    "genericWorker": {
      "config": {
        "deploymentId": "axlvK6p9SNa-HJgPCVXKEA",
        "ed25519SigningKeyLocation": "C:\\generic-worker\\generic-worker-ed25519-signing-key.key",
        "idleTimeoutSecs": 60,
        "livelogCertificate": "C:\\generic-worker\\livelog.crt",
        "livelogExecutable": "C:\\generic-worker\\livelog.exe",
        "livelogKey": "C:\\generic-worker\\livelog.key",
        "openpgpSigningKeyLocation": "C:\\generic-worker\\generic-worker-gpg-signing-key.key",
        "shutdownMachineOnInternalError": false,
        "subdomain": "taskcluster-worker.net",
        "taskclusterProxyExecutable": "C:\\generic-worker\\taskcluster-proxy.exe",
        "workerTypeMetadata": {
          "machine-setup": {
            "maintainer": "pmoore@mozilla.com",
            "script": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taskcluster/generic-worker/53f1d934688f9e9c6ba60db6cc9185e5c9e9c0ce/worker_types/nss-win2012r2/userdata"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },

v13.0.1
=======

Please do not use this release! It is broken.

v13.0.0
=======

Please do not use this release! It is broken.

In v12.0.0 since v11.1.1
========================

The backwardly incompatible change for version 12 is that you need to create both a openpgp signing key
_and_ an ed25519 signing key before running the worker.

```
    generic-worker new-ed25519-keypair      --file ED25519-PRIVATE-KEY-FILE
    generic-worker new-openpgp-keypair      --file OPENPGP-PRIVATE-KEY-FILE
```

Note, *both* are required.

The config property `signingKeyLocation` has been renamed to `openpgpSigningKeyLocation` and the new config property
`ed25519SigningKeyLocation` is needed. For _example_, could changes could look like this:

```diff
-        "signingKeyLocation": "C:\\generic-worker\\generic-worker-gpg-signing-key.key",
+        "openpgpSigningKeyLocation": "C:\\generic-worker\\generic-worker-gpg-signing-key.key",
+        "ed25519SigningKeyLocation": "C:\\generic-worker\\generic-worker-ed25519-signing-key.key",
```

In v11.0.0 since v10.11.3
=========================

The backwardly incompatible change for version 11 is that you need to specify `--configure-for-aws`
at installation time, if the workers will run in AWS. Previously, this was assumed to always be
the case.

```
